Simulates forest fires with cellular automata

THIS PROJECT ONLY OPERATES UNDER LINUX

There are two main files: Controller and CAModel

Controller runs a small gui to control the model
CAModel runs all of the model calculations.

The project can be compiled with the supplied ant build file by invoking

ant



you will need gnuplot installed

To see a list of possible arguments run: java Controller

The program is run with run with:

java Controller <lattice-width> <lattice-height> <q> <p> <f> [<burn-resistance> <wind-x> <wind-y>] | gnuplot -persist

Where arguments inside the [] are optional model extensions. However all must be included if you wish to use any of them.

Defaults for extensions:
burn-resist: -1
wind-x: 0
wind-y: 0

These values will cause the model to run as if the extensions are not present.


When you run the Controller you should be presented with a small GUI with buttons to control the model interactively.

The basic functions of the Controller are: play, stop, step, reset and save snapshot
Which behave as you would expect them to. The saving function saves a .png image of the current model using the 'display' program

Also included are functions that start fires:
Random fire - ignites a single random tree
Set fire at centre - ignites a small circle of trees in the centre of the lattice
Circle fire - uses the text boxes to define the centre and radius of a circle to ignite (uses only the first two co-ord boxes)
Line fire - allows you to define two points using the text boxes and ignites a line of trees between those points
